# Merge Sort

**It takes an array and divides it in half continuously until each sub-array has a length of 1. Then each of the sub-arrays is summed in (ascending) order at the top of the call stack until the entire array is sorted.**


## Challenge

- Write a blog post stepping through the insertion sort algorithm
- Code a working, tested implementation of insertion sort based on the provided pseudocode that takes in an array and returns the same array sorted.


## Approach & Efficiency

 - O(n log n) time 
 - O(n) space

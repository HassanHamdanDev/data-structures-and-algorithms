# Singly Linked List

* Creating methods for singly linked lists.

## Challenge

```

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored int he Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty linked list should be created.
Define a method called insert, which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the linked list formatted as: { a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL

```


- [x]  Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- [x] Can properly insert into the linked list
- [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
